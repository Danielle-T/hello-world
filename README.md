# hello-world
A test repository
I am testing out how this works.
<b>bold text</b>
<em>italic text</em>
<p>I am writing a <b>bold</b> paragraph of text, but I may want some in <em>italics</em>, who knows. As long as it's a paragraph.<p>
<p>And then a new paragraph starts below.</p>
<h1> "But what about an h1 header?" You say.</h1>
<h2> "Yes, what about it?" I say. "An h2 header is just as good."</h2>
But sometimes I really just want a line break <br> in the middle of a sentence!

<body style="background-color:powderblue;">
<p>Why powder blue? I don't know. I just like it."<p>
</body>
<body style="background-color:red;">
<p>Well, I like red.<p>
</body>
<h1 style="color:blue;verdana;">I like my h1s blue and verdana</h1>
<h2 style="color:red;courier;">Always with the h1s. I prefer h2s and red courier is better.</h2>
<p style="color:purple;verdana">Whatever. Body copy is fine and purple is the best. Verdana, eh, I'll go with it for now.<p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Well, the colors didn't work. But maybe alignment will?</h1>

<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {
background-color: green;
}
div {
background-color: lightblue;
}
p {background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is my example of CSS background color!<h1>
<div>
This is a text inside a div element.
<p>This pargraph has its own background color.<p>
But we're still in the div element.
</div>
</body>
</html>
